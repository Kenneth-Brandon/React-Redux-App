describe the Finite State Machine pattern and it's relationship to building Redux applications

A state machine is a mathematical model of computation. Itâ€™s an abstract concept whereby the machine can have different states, but at a given time fulfills only one of them.

implement Redux Middleware libraries into a Redux Store using `applyMiddleware`

Redux Middleware intercepts every action that is dispatched before it gets to the reducer - Middleware can: stop actions - forward an action untouched - dispatch a different action (or change the action itself) - dispatch multiple actions

effectively use `redux-thunk` and asynchronous action creators to consume data from external API's
